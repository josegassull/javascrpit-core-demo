--JavaScript Information and Context--

(Even though I present info and context here, I exemplify most of this aspects in the code of the system where you can see the usage of punctual properties)

1. Language characteristics:
   -Dynamic Typing: In JavaScript, variables do not have a fixed type. The data type
   is determined at runtime.
   -Interpreted Language: JavaScript runs line by line in the browser or in a runtime
   environment (like Node.js) without the need for prior compilation.
   -Prototype-based Language: Unlike classical inheritance based on classes
   (like in Java), JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance.
   The syntax for classes since ES6(ECMAScript 2015) is more legible and modern, but
   is in reality a way of syntactic sugar over the subjacent prototype system of
   JavaScript.
   -First-Class Functions: Functions in JavaScript can be assigned to variables,
   passed as arguments, and returned by other functions.
   -Asynchrony and Callbacks: JavaScript is known for its asynchronous execution model,
   using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
   -Execution Context and 'this': The value of 'this' in JavaScript depends on the
   context in which a function is called, which can be confusing for beginners.
   -JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
   that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

2. Variables, attributes and data types
3. Conditionals
4. Iterations
5. Functions
6. Recursion
7. Classes, constructors and class relations
8. Interfaces
9. Polymorphism

10. Encapsulation and modifiers:
    JavaScript has many ways to achieve encapsulation and to protect data including closures, constructor functions, class syntax, and WeakMap
